# TRVL
A Travel Agency Platform composed of a RESTful Web API that communicates with both an Android and a Web app.  
The Goal behind this project is to create a platform on which a client and a agent can communicate in a controlled manner (through a defined process) in order to provide services such as crafting a vacation/trip for the client according to his requirements.
  
The project follows the MVC design pattern.
The RESTful API communicates with the DB and uses JSON to comunicate with both the Android app and the Web app.  
JWT is used for authorization.  
The Web app uses JQuery (AJAX) to communicate with the API and Materialize CSS for the design.
